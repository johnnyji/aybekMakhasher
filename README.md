This is a professional website I'm currently building for a local aspiring cook from Vancouver B.C. 

This is my first official client and 3rd overall project, and it's so far taught me:

- jQuery
- How to use the Instsgram API
- Responsive design
- Minimalistic design
- How to work with clients to bring an idea to life
